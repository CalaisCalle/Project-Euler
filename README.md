# My Attempts at Problems From Project Euler

## What/Why?
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of mathematical and computational problems requiring a combination of both skills to solve.
The website was first recommended to me by a colleague and I decided to give it a go.
With a bit of luck, it will help me to improve in both areas.

## How?

The language I'm most familiar with, by far, is python. 
I wouldn't consider myself an expert by any stretch, but it's probably the language I'm most familiar with.
That being said, I also want to improve my C++ skills for both professional and personal reasons.
For this reason, this repository will likely have solutions written in a mixture of Python and C++, which will vary from problem-to-problem.

Ideally, I would like to first solve the problem in Python, then implement that solution in C++.
Eventually, I'd like to have improved my C++ ability to the point where I'm comfortable solving problems in C++ exclusively.

My plan is to progress through the problems in order of difficulty, from easiest to hardest.
By doing this I hope to first construct a solid foundation which I can then build upon. 

## When?

Whenever I get around to it, really.
I tend to procrastinate a bit, and even more outside of work: there's a good chance I'll end up doing this on my lunch break.

## Who?

I'm [Max Call√©](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-calle/), a Graduate Software Developer for AudioTelligence, who specialise in hearing assistance through Blind Source Separation (BSS).
My background is mostly in Physics, since it was my Bacheror's degree; this is also where I first learned Python.
Thanks to that part of my life, I have a half-decent understanding of maths already.
